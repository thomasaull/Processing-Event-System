#Processing-Event-System

This is an attempt to create an event system for [processing](processing.org/) which is modeled after the ActionScript 3 Event System. It provides the ability to connect and disconnect different classes loosely with Events which can „listen“ to events and call a function if this events occurs.

This is under development and more a proof-of-concept than a finished library. At the moment it’s only usable if you develop your processing sketches with [Eclipse](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/craft-your-processing-sketches-in-eclipse/). Even though it is working it’s definitely **not** bug-free!

Take a look in „Usage.java“ and „myEvent.java“ if you want to learn how you use it with custom event types.
